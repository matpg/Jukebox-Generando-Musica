The hps are for a V100 GPU with 16 GB GPU memory. The 1b_lyrics, 5b, and 5b_lyrics top-level priors take up 3.8 GB, 10.3 GB, and 11.5 GB, respectively. The peak memory usage to store transformer key, value cache is about 400 MB for 1b_lyrics and 1 GB for 5b_lyrics per sample. If you are having trouble with CUDA OOM issues, try 1b_lyrics or decrease max_batch_size in sample.py, and --n_samples in the script call.
